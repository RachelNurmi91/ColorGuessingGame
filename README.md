# ColorMatchingGame

Designed a browser game where the player must guess the correct color. The player must choose from a set of colors. The correct color is randomly generated. If the player does not select from the set of colors the game will alert them. If the player chooses the wrong color then they will be given a hint. Once the player selects the right color they are notified and the background changes to match the correct color.
